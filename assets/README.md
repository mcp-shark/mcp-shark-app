# Assets

This directory contains application assets like icons.

## Icon

Place your application icon here as `icon.png` (or `.ico` for Windows, `.icns` for macOS).

For now, the app will work without an icon, but you can add one later for a better user experience.

Recommended sizes:
- **macOS**: 512x512 PNG or ICNS format
- **Windows**: 256x256 ICO format  
- **Linux**: 512x512 PNG format
